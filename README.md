BlockEdfSummarizeFig
====================

Simple interface for summarizing the contents of a folder containing EDFs and XML files

#### Applications
BlockEdfsummarizeFig was initially developed to review the contents of large number of EDF/XML files. The functional components of the tool have been integrated within batch analysis programs to serve as a pre-run check.  Applying the checks within BlockEdfSummarizeFig is the first step is performing large scale spectral analysis. See our [spectral analysis](https://github.com/DennisDean/SpectralTrainFig) program description or our [standard operating procedure](https://github.com/DennisDean/SpectralTrainFig/blob/master/standardOperatingProcedure.md) for performing spectral analysis for additional details.

#### Quick Application Steps

Only a few simple steps simple steps
